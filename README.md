# Collaborative FizzBuzz Exercise

A short exercise to practice test driven development with [TomJamesDuffy](https://github.com/TomJamesDuffy)

## Running tests

Obviously you will need RSpec in order to run the tests.

```
gem install rspec
```

To use the 'fizzbuzz' method, require the following file.

```
lib/fizzbuzz.rb
```

Once inside the parent directory use `rspec` to run the tests:

```
cd fizzbuzz
rspec
```
